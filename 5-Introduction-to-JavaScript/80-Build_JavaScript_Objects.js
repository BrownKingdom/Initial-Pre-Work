<!-- Objects are similar to arrays, objects use indexes to access and modify their data, which data objects that are called properties. -->
// Example
var ourDog = {
  "name": "Camper",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["everything!"]
};

// Only change code below this line.

var myDog = {
  "name": "string",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["hooray!"]
};
